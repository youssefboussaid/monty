# Monty

## Description
The Monty language
Monty 0.98 is a scripting language that is first compiled into Monty byte codes (Just like Python). It relies on a unique stack, with specific instructions to manipulate it. The goal of this project is to create an interpreter for Monty ByteCodes files.

### Monty byte code files

Files containing Monty byte codes usually have the .m extension. Most of the industry uses this standard but it is not required by the specification of the language. There is not more than one instruction per line. There can be any number of spaces before or after the opcode and its argument:
```
push 0
push 1
push 2
  push 3
                   pall
push 4
    push 5
      push    6
pall
```
Monty byte code files can contain blank lines (empty or made of spaces only, and any additional text after the opcode or its required argument is not taken into account.
```
julien@ubuntu:~/monty$ cat -e bytecodes/001.m
push 0 Push 0 onto the stack$
push 1 Push 1 onto the stack$
$
push 2$
  push 3$
                   pall    $
$
$
                           $
push 4$
$
    push 5    $
      push    6        $
$
pall This is the end of our program. Monty is awesome!$
julien@ubuntu:~/monty$
```
## Usage
`./monty file` where `file` is the path to the file containing Monty byte code.

The monty program runs the bytecodes line by line and stops if either:
 - It executed properly every line of the file
 - It finds an error in the file
 - An error occured

## Installation
First, clone this repository onto your local machine using:
```
git clone https://github.com/ethanpasta/monty.git
```
After `cd`ing into the directory, compile all files with:
```
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o monty
```
You should now have a `monty` executable file.
